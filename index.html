        rationale: `The nurse should advise the family to spend as much time as possible with the child.

Hematocrit is a blood test that measures the percentage of the volume of whole blood that is made up of RBCs. This measurement depends on the number and size of RBCs in the vascular system, as well as the amount of fluid in blood. An “excess” of fluid in the intravascular space (e.g., overhydration) would explain a low hematocrit value because the number of cells would appear low in relation to the fluid volume.
